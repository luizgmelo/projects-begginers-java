# Projects Begginers
I know that if you want to be good in anything you need practice
as the most you can, so theses days I want to do simple begginers
projects to level up my skill with Java Programming Language, so
I meet this website that link is down below and create this repo
with all projects. Feel comfortable to understand my version and
the website version and of course BUILD YOUR OWN! So you will learn
with this process.
